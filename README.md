## Model Comparison and Analysis

| Model             | Window Size | Training Loss | Training Time | Syntactic Accuracy | Semantic Accuracy |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Skipgram (model1)          | 2     | 9.559290        | 5m 41s      | 0.00%            | 0.00%           |
| Skipgram (NEG) (model2)    | 2     | 2.230449        | 5m 35s       | 0.00%            | 0.00%           |
| Glove (model3)            | 2     | 0.131319       | 1m 6s      | 0.00%            | 0.00%           |
| Glove (Gensim) (model4)    | -     | -       | -       | 55.45%            | 93.87%           |

## Correlation Scores

| Model               | Skipgram | Skipgram (NEG) | GloVe | GloVe (Gensim) |
|---------------------|-----------|----------------|-------|----------------|
| MSE            | -0.0100   | -0.0562        | -0.0735 | 0.6019      |

- In this scenario, firstly i want to choose model4 which is GloVe(Gensim) but the Keyvector has no attributes for word embedding.
So, my conclusion i will choose Skipgram model which is model1. It has the least negative correlation among the four, indicating it may slightly outperform the others in aligning with others data.
